# DeFi 2.0 and Gold Backed Token as Yield Bearing Digital Asset

$GODL gold-backed cryptocurrency, a digital asset whose value is fully insured, including for coverage of embezzlement and terrorism.

We provide Stakeholders with Evidence of Insurance certificate (EOI), issued as an NFT. The EOI is issued in the wallet address of the stakeholder and confirms the value insured at the Treasury equivalent price in gold of 1 Kilo of Gold.&#x20;

Each GLYD Token defines a single one of its tokens arbitrarily as having an equivalent worth of 1KG of gold, and this equivalent will be present in the reserves/vaults as individual, segregated and allocated custody storage. This is in contrast to many banks and other storage services, which often only offer unsegregated and/or unallocated storage, especially for larger quantities.

Some gold-backed tokens even allow for the redemption of the tokens back for gold.&#x20;

Unlike most cryptocurrencies that have speculative value, a gold-backed token’s value is tied to a tangible asset, which cushions it against severe price fluctuations and because of this makes the optimal use case for an algorithmic reserve currency as the first numismatic depiction of gold with the [lion's seal](https://coinweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1059602\_\_54666.1587475207.jpg) in Lydia 500BCE.&#x20;

The majority of gold-backed cryptocurrencies exist as ERC-20 standard tokens, although there are exceptions such as Paxos’ PAX Gold.&#x20;

Blockchain-based digital assets backed by gold and other real-world scarce commodities are becoming increasingly appealing for investors looking to hedge their portfolios against weakening fiat currencies or regulation-bound stablecoins.&#x20;

The biggest advantage that digital versions of gold hold over their physical counterparts is that they can be divided into any small unit or amount and transferred to another party as well as being bought by other protocols or investors as a hedge against inflation or crisis. we assume is the most predictable asset with regard to its use as money.

&#x20;or if you really want to hold your assets we will send you kilos of gold.

Gold-backed cryptocurrencies have, however, historically struggled with systemic issues, such as:

a) low liquidity (as they aren’t generally traded across many exchanges);&#x20;

b) ascertaining the proof of reserves (determining whether the company has the claimed reserves and gold backing or not);&#x20;

c) a dependence on central parties for collateral safekeeping and auditing, which practically defeats their purpose as “cryptocurrencies,” as one of the necessary properties of cryptocurrencies is decentralization.
