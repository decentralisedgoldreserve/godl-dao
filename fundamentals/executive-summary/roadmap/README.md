Much on our roadmap speaks for itself. We do however want to share a brief explanation regarding several key items:

#### Lending and Borrowing Protocol <a href="#lending-and-borrowing-protocol" id="lending-and-borrowing-protocol"></a>

Lydus will integrate an open interest rate protocol that allows users to lend and borrow digital assets, all within the Lydus Co Financial Ecosystem. Lenders can achieve an attractive APY without any risk of volatility of the $GODL price by lending out stable coins. Borrowers can use sGODL as a collateral to leverage their position or borrow stablecoins to use them in different projects without having to unstake sGODL. The benefit for the protocol is that the treasury collects fees, consisting of the difference between APR for borrowers and APY for lenders. This way, the treasury increases, which in return has a positive impact on Lydus Co APY.&#x20;

The Lending and borrowing protocol will come with it’s own UI.

#### Cross-chain Liquidity <a href="#cross-chain-liquidity" id="cross-chain-liquidity"></a>

The liquidity of Lydus Co currently exists on Avalanche. Cross-chain liquidity allows Lydus Co to reach new users on other chains, as Fantom Opera is still an upcoming chain with fewer users than (for example) Ethereum. We expect that having pools on other chains will further grow Lydus Co user base on these chains, and allow for a significant accumulation of gold in our treasury.

#### Lydus Co PRO <a href="#hector-pro" id="hector-pro"></a>

A protocol owned seigniorage-as-a-service, Lydus Co PRO provides a custom proof-quality coin stamping customised to our Partner's needs. Any protocol interested in using Bonds will be able to use Lydus Co PRO. Lydus Co PRO will invest in the aquisition of the required infrastructure and provide major exposure and guaranteed insurance.&#x20;

The advantage for the Lydus Co financial ecosystem is that seigniorage services will benefit the treasury of the community and the collectors of $GODL's triple nature coins.
