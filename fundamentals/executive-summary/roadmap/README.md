Much on our roadmap speaks for itself. We do however want to share a brief explanation regarding several key items:

#### Lending and Borrowing Protocol <a href="#lending-and-borrowing-protocol" id="lending-and-borrowing-protocol"></a>

Lydus will integrate an open interest rate protocol that allows users to lend and borrow digital assets, all within the Lydus Co Financial Ecosystem. Lenders can achieve an attractive APY without any risk of volatility of the GODL price by lending out stable coins. Borrowers can use sGODL as a collateral to leverage their position or borrow stablecoins to use them in different projects without having to unstake sGODL. The benefit for the protocol is that the treasury collects fees, consisting of the difference between APR for borrowers and APY for lenders. This way, the treasury increases, which in return has a positive impact on Lydus Co APY. The Lending and borrowing protocol will come with itâ€™s own UI.

#### Cross-chain Liquidity <a href="#cross-chain-liquidity" id="cross-chain-liquidity"></a>

The liquidity of Lydus Co currently exists on ????. Cross-chain liquidity will allow Lydus Co to reach new users on other chains, as ????? is still an upcoming chain with fewer users than (for example) Ethereum. The chains we will target will be announced shortly. We expect that having pools on other chains will further grow Lydus Co user base on these chains, and allow for a significant influx of treasury funds.

#### Lydus Co PRO <a href="#hector-pro" id="hector-pro"></a>

A protocol owned liquidity-as-a-service, Lydus Co PRO provides a custom treasury and bonds optimized to individual needs. Any protocol interested in using Bonds will be able to use Lydus Co PRO. Lydus Co PRO takes care of the required infrastructure and provides major exposure to upcoming projects. The advantage for the Lydus Co financial ecosystem is that Hector PRO will benefit the treasury
