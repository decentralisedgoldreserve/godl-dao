# Executive Summary

**Mission: Build a decentralized financial infrastructure backed by liquid-proof yield-bearing gold bullion coins, generate and distribute wealth, to build a stable financial economy for the world.**

This executive summary is intended to provide a solution to the current issues regarding stores of value, currency inflation, and to offer a roadmap for the future of monetary systems, shedding light on the current macroeconomic conditions of the world.

### HISTORY <a href="#history" id="history"></a>

#### Fiat Money <a href="#the-fiat-experiment-failed" id="the-fiat-experiment-failed"></a>

The reality is that U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the word “transitory” is no longer the most accurate term for describing the nature of the current high inflation rate in describing how long high inflation is expected to last.

Powell also said it would be appropriate for the central bank to consider wrapping up its “taper” of large-scale bond purchases more quickly based on the strength of the economy and high rate of inflation

&#x20;It should not be much of a surprise in the time of the most rapid expansion in science and technology that the world’s form and use of currency would also be re-envisioned and recreated. Central banks across the world have failed the people. We can see a stark example of this playing out as the gap between the rich and the poor grows. For reference, **the world's richest 1% have more than twice as much wealth as 6.9 billion people** ([source](https://www.oxfam.org/en/5-shocking-facts-about-extreme-global-inequality-and-how-even-it)).The buck starts with central banking. The infrastructure currently in place disproportionately benefits major institutions like governments and commercial banks while enabling a system that breeds debt stricken lifestyles for the average family. The key issue is the cycle of privatized gains and socialized losses that the current banking system condones.Inflation in the United States hit a 31-year high in October of this year and can be attributed to faulty governance of the US dollar by the Federal Reserve, dangerous policymaking by the U.S. government, as well as other factors including responses to the COVID-19 pandemic ([source](https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-inflation-consumer-price-index-october-2021-11636491959)). But the general issue did not start in the past year.

#### The 2008 Financial Crisis <a href="#the-2008-financial-crisis" id="the-2008-financial-crisis"></a>

The narrative that is told of the Great Recession of 2008 is that it was mostly caused by homeowners that could not payback their loans and by banks that mistakenly loaned to risky borrowers. The less popular, but more realistic take on the 2008 financial crisis is that, “financial institutions actually sought out risky mortgage loans in pursuit of profits from high-yielding securities, and to do so, held onto high-risk investments while engaging in multiple sectors of the mortgage securitization industry.” ([source](https://irle.berkeley.edu/what-really-caused-the-great-recession/))In simple terms, **the large financial institutions that were later bailed out by major governments operated a system in which they would accept risky borrowers so that they could capitalize at every step of the mortgage securitization process** (lending, underwriting, servicing, and securitizing).The popular narrative was built to favor the banks so that our current financial system would survive and so that in general people would accept massive bailouts given to the perpetrators of the meltdown (the banks).

#### The Birth of Cryptocurrency <a href="#the-birth-of-cryptocurrency" id="the-birth-of-cryptocurrency"></a>

There was a positive that rose from this dim reality. Out of this financial crash decentralized cryptocurrency was born- a bright and shimmering light guiding the way for a new financial future.Cryptocurrency holds fast to the ideals of open source data, decentralization, secureness, and efficiency. In contrast to the manner of the Fed and other national reserve banks, cryptocurrency has the potential to be of and by the people. It is a scalable infrastructure that can save humanity from another cycle of financial catastrophe.

#### DAOs - a replacement for banks <a href="#daos-a-replacement-for-banks" id="daos-a-replacement-for-banks"></a>

Without central banks we must ask what the proper replacement would be. It is becoming clear that decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), with clear and just representative systems in place, constitute a suitable replacement for central banks.DAOs represent freedom and an efficient way to form a representative democracy. Participants in an economic, political, or environmental system should have the capacity to actively take part in important decisions regarding policy and other related facets of its organizational structure. DAOs help facilitate this in a very efficient manner.In 2008, would you have decided to favor the risky behavior of commercial banks and bail them out, or would you have rather voted in favor of identifying and solving the root cause of the financial meltdown?It was not up to you in 2008, but it can be going forward.

#### BTC is Not the Next Global Currency <a href="#btc-is-not-the-next-global-currency" id="btc-is-not-the-next-global-currency"></a>

In the years prior, Bitcoin has been considered a possible exit from the fiat system, but from our current standpoint, this doesn’t seem likely to occur.Bitcoin is digital gold; there is a fixed amount, it continues to rise in value, and it is scarce. People are hesitant to spend it because of these characteristics. Bitcoin and Ethereum are a valuable part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, but do not serve as a proper digital currency. Although, just how gold once backed the dollar, since these assets are considered digital gold, they can be used to back true use case currencies.Some characteristics of a true currency that bitcoin and other related cryptocurrencies do not hold include maintaining relative price stability and usability. This can be accomplished by increasing supply as new participants and resources join the ecosystem.

### OUR SOLUTION <a href="#our-solution" id="our-solution"></a>

#### A Currency by and for the People <a href="#a-currency-by-and-for-the-people" id="a-currency-by-and-for-the-people"></a>

We envision a currency that benefits its holders and empowers new wealth creation globally. We believe that this currency should be managed by a DAO so that the benefits are not disproportionately allocated to the fortunate few, like the manner in which central banking currently behaves.

#### Introducing $GURU <a href="#introducing-usdguru" id="introducing-usdguru"></a>

$GURU is the embodiment of this vision. The word guru means the dispeller of darkness which we find fit for its role to spread light through the world by empowering new participants with wealth creation and providing a just financial infrastructure and currency.$GURU will exist on the Polygon network in order to accommodate lower gas fees so that anyone across the world has access to fair entry into the ecosystem. This opens the possibility for low income citizens of all nations to participate early and foster new, life changing wealth creation for their businesses, families and communities.

#### Treasures - that’s what’s in the treasury <a href="#treasures-thats-whats-in-the-treasury" id="treasures-thats-whats-in-the-treasury"></a>

$GURU will be backed by real world assets such as gold, fine wine, and art. Backing a currency with assets that maintain or grow in value provides a hedge against inflation.If, for example, your currency is backed solely by stablecoins, then you are still tied to fiat currency (USD). Therefore, as inflation of fiat rises, the purchasing power of your backing is reduced; diminishing the overall value of your currency. This is one of the many reasons why $GURU will be backed by physical assets as well as a diversified basket of digital currencies.NidhiDAO, from the root Nidhi, signifying a treasure consisting of nine treasures, is the decentralized algorithmic currency protocol that governs the $GURU token. Token holders have the power to take part in NidhiDAO governance through representative token voting.The onboarding of physical assets into Nidhi’s treasury will be accomplished through our partnership with [Tangible](https://linktr.ee/tangible.store), a TNFT platform that enables you to buy and sell real world assets in the form of NFTs.

#### Three Pillars of The Model <a href="#three-pillars-of-the-model" id="three-pillars-of-the-model"></a>

The financial model for $GURU is one of the most distinctive facets that places it a step above other cryptocurrencies. There are three pillars of the model which include staking, bonding, and protocol owned liquidity.**Staking is the primary way that participants in $GURU gain value. Stakers stake their $GURU on the NidhiDAO website to earn rebase rewards. These rewards are calculated in terms of APY and are sent in the form of the native token $GURU.**Bonding is the secondary way that participants in $GURU gain value. It helps Nidhi acquire its own liquidity and build its treasury by selling $GURU at a discount in exchange for assets such as DAI, LP positions, and physical assets in the form of TNFTs.Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) ensures that there is always exit liquidity available for participants in the ecosystem so that market operations are gracefully facilitated and to protect token holders. As Nidhi acquires greater shares of its own liquidity, this also increases revenue from LP rewards which helps bolster the treasury.This model was invented by OlympusDAO. NidhiDAO is proud to be an OHM fork and gives credit to the creators of OlympusDAO for enlightening the world to this monetary philosophy and financial infrastructure.As an expression of belief in the OHM model, Nidhi will be holding reserves of wsOHM in its treasury as well as designating proportions of pGURU to the Olympus treasury.

#### Going Forward <a href="#going-forward" id="going-forward"></a>

$GURU is a once in a lifetime opportunity to re-imagine money and redistribute wealth. Our belief is that there is room for abundance for all.In the past, central banks have enabled a debt cycle that disempowers people within nations and abroad. $GURU is a necessary step for humanity to take back the rights to their financial freedom.Renowned American architect Buckminster Fuller said it best,“You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.”**The GURU model is set to make the existing global financial model obsolete.
