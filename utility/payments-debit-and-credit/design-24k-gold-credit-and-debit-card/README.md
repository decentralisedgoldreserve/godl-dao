**Good to know:** depending on the product you're building, it can be useful to explicitly document use cases. Got a product that can be used by a bunch of people in different ways? Maybe consider splitting it out!

### Why Lydus Co?

Lydus Co is an algorithmic reserve currency protocol based on the GLYD token. Each GLYD token backed by 99.9% Gold Proof Coins in individual, segregated and allocated custody storage, giving it a stable intrinsic value, the price of gold as in the last 10 years remained, the [same](https://goldprice.org/gold-price-history.html).&#x20;

Our goal is to create a decentralised gold reserve currency, controlled by autonomous systems, in which the behaviour of the GLYD token is optimised at a high level by the collective organisation.&#x20;

In economic terms, we believe this methodology will consistently offer stability as the GLYD can function as a universal unit-of-account and a medium-of-exchange. Our unique innovation backing the token to gold makes it also profitable to be stored for value growth and wealth creation. Lydus Co also introduces unique gamified financial dynamics into the market through staking and bonding. Read more about the game theory aspect of Lydus Co in MEDIUM LINK.

Lydus Co can solve many critical problems of the gold markets, such as; illiquidity, opacity, and inefficiency.  By delivering on our objectives, a huge disruption of the financial markets and re-standardisation of a new automated monetary policy system backed by gold.

### How does Lydus Co do it?

There are two main methods for market stakeholders to participation: stamping and sealing. Stampers stamp their GLYD tokens in return for more GLYD tokens, while sealers provide LP or DAI tokens  through the Pactolus River smart contract in exchange for discounted GLYD tokens after a fixed vesting period.&#x20;

Governance stakeholders can get involved on our forum and through discussions on our community discord and DAO discord servers respectively. We are always looking for new community members to contribute!



In contrast, with unallocated storage, clients possess only the rights on any unspecified gold, or precious metals owned by the bank, or other storage facilities, but they do not legally own specific bullions, bars or coins. In such a case, precious metals “owned” by clients constitute a part of the bank’s or storage facility’s own assets, unless it is stored individually in a segregated form and in the name of the client.

In this case, precious metals are legally owned by our clients and do not constitute a part of a bank’s or storage facility’s own assets.&#x20;

Our clients’ precious metals do not form a part of our own assets and are not assets of anybody else. They legally belong solely to our specific clients.&#x20;

The assets are stored individually in a segregated form and in the name of the client that is the only holder of the private keys corresponding to the unique serial number on the created, mintable and tradable NFT-backed token.  mandatorily marked and serialized before being placed on the market.

The advantages for our clients are clear: Client assets are fully shielded from any unlikely claims of third parties against us.

All precious metals within our storage facilities in Liechtenstein, whether they belong to our clients or to us, are fully insured, including coverage of embezzlement and terrorism.&#x20;

We provide our clients with an - Evidence of Insurance certificate (EOI), issued by our insurer. The EOI is issued in the name of the client and also confirms the value insured.

In the event of a future sale, our clients have detailed evidence of their assets, which covers all precious metal transactions effected.

### What Lydus Co can do?

\


This is done for security, coding, and traceability reasons.



A Gold NFT is a rwaNFT tethered to actual physical gold bullion secured in vaults around the world. The token owner can redeem the token for physical delivery of the gold bar(s) at any time, with solid legal guarantees around all parties holding up their end of the arrangement. Easily, globally transactable.
