# Staking- Hot & Cold Storage

## What is the Staking function?

**Staking is the primary strategy for aggregating value for Lydus Co**.&#x20;

Stakeholders stake their $GODL on the Lydus Co website to earn rebase rewards (coupon payments). The rebase rewards come from the proceeds of minting coins, and can vary based on the number of GODL staked in the protocol and the reward rate set by monetary policy

We provide individual, segregated and allocated custody storage of the gold.

The seal numbers of storage boxes in which gold, silver, or other precious metals are stored, are noted and listed in the client’s storage confirmation and in client inventory reports (NFT Registry).&#x20;

Our clients’ precious metals do not form a part of our own assets and are not assets of anybody else.&#x20;

They legally belong solely to the specific clients' wallet addresses and do not constitute part of the organisation of the bank’s or storage facility’s own assets. In this way, Lydus Co operates a semi-autonomous decentralised organisationion. It is stored individually in a segregated form and in the name of the clients' wallet addresses.

**Staking is a passive, long-term strategy.**&#x20;

The increase in your stake of GODL translates into a constantly falling cost basis, converging on zero. This means even if the market price of GODL drops below your initial purchase price, given a long enough staking period, the increase in your staked GODL balance should eventually outpace the fall in price.

## What makes Staking and Wrapping necessary?

**When you stake, you lock GODL and receive an equal amount of sGODL.**&#x20;

Your sGODL balance rebases up automatically at the end of every epoch. sGODL is transferable and therefore composable with other DeFi protocols.

**When you unstake, you burn sGODL and receive an equal amount of GODL.**&#x20;

NO VAT

Unstaking means the user will forfeit the upcoming rebase reward. Note that the forfeited reward is only applicable to the unstaked amount; the remaining staked GODL (if any) will continue to receive rebase rewards.&#x20;
