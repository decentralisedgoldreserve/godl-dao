# 🦁 The Algorithmic Reserve Currency backed by Gold

{% hint style="success" %}
Lydus Co is an algorithmic reserve currency protocol based on the $GODL token. Each $GODL token accrues yield by acquiring Gold in Grade X (Grade 10) Vaults, giving it an intrinsic and stable value ([same](https://goldprice.org/gold-price-history.html)) money that has been used for thousands of years now truly creating a risk-free distributed money.
{% endhint %}

> We offer fully insured segregated and allocated storage with no counter-party risk, ensuring that our clients are the legal owners of their gold or have it delivered to them. — Vault Management

> Our partners sell gold in all customary forms in-house from own stocks at the main storage location in Liechtenstein, without the need for transport, and under very competitive conditions.— Partnerships

## The Decentralised Gold Standard

**Invest in the future of gold and finance.**

The journey to Lydus' Co adoption of a gold standard can be traced through the future of Minting Function. As the Founder of the Protocol, Michalis Papaiakovou issued a paper in 2021 that led to the $GODL, assigning it a fixed value. Following the Pactolus Protocol of the Decentralised Reserve Currencies, blockchain’s gold standard could get adopted and would be the first system of its type in the world.&#x20;

Several DAOs with large Treasuries can follow Lydus Co, lead, including Olympus DAO, Wonderland Money and many other blockchain projects.&#x20;

Designed in 2022 to mark the next hundreds, of years of monetary systems since the de facto introduction of the blockchain gold standard - tying the value of the $GODL to that of gold. The Blockchain Gold Standard 2022 bullion coin is a unique, annual offering from Lydus Co. Featuring the Lion Emoji on its reverse, and the unique NFT, QR Code on the obverse making it an art of digital numismatic science.&#x20;

One $GODL token is both one-ounce bullion coin struck in 999.9 fine gold in collectable proof quality.

{% hint style="success" %}
Our goal is to create a decentralised gold reserve currency, controlled by autonomous systems, in which the behaviour of the GODL token is optimised at a high level by the collective organisation of participants and the global gold supply.

### Guides: Pactolus Protocol

Lydus Co is a fork of $OHM on Avalanche. Buy $GODL from the market or use the Pactolus River (coinage system) and then stamp it with the lion's seal (stake it) to receive more $GODL.

### Fundamentals: Dive a little deeper

In economic terms, we believe this methodology will consistently offer stability as the $GODL can function as a universal unit-of-account and a medium-of-exchange. Our unique innovation backing the token to gold makes it also profitable to be stored for value growth and wealth creation. Lydus Co also introduces unique gamified financial dynamics into the market through staking and bonding. Read more about the game theory aspect of Lydus Co in MEDIUM LINK.
