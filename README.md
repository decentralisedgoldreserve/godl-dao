# 🦁 The Algorithmic Reserve Currency made of Gold

{% hint style="success" %}
Lydus Co is an algorithmic reserve currency backed by a decentralised immutable registry of NFT ownership and insurance protocol based on the $GODL token and made with gold.&#x20;

Each $GODL token accrues yield by the network effects of acquiring gold collectively or centralised in Grade X (Grade 10) Vaults, both fully insured and tax-free, with an intrinsic and stable value same ([same](https://goldprice.org/gold-price-history.html)) money that are always tradable both physically and electronically.&#x20;

What has been used for thousands of years now has been redesigned, creating risk-free distributed money for our community because the faith and credit of the industry support it.

Of all the minerals that are mined, none is more useful than gold, Geology.com [says](https://geology.com/minerals/gold/uses-of-gold.shtml). That’s because gold conducts electricity, doesn’t tarnish, can be combined with other metals, can easily be melted and shaped, and has a brilliant luster.

## The Decentralised Gold Standard

**Invest in the future of gold and finance.**

The journey to Lydus' Co adoption of a gold standard can be traced through the future of Minting Function. As the Founder of the Protocol, Michalis Papaiakovou issued a paper in 2021 that led to the $GODL, assigning it a fixed value. Following the Pactolus Protocol of the Decentralised Reserve Currencies, blockchain’s gold standard could get adopted and would be the first system of its type in the world.&#x20;

Several DAOs with large Treasuries can follow Lydus Co, lead, including Olympus DAO, Wonderland Money and many other blockchain projects.&#x20;

Designed in 2022 to mark the next hundreds, of years of monetary systems since the de facto introduction of the blockchain gold standard - tying the value of the $GODL to that of gold. The Blockchain Gold Standard 2022 bullion coin is a unique, annual offering from Lydus Co. Featuring the Lion Emoji on its reverse, and the unique NFT, QR Code on the obverse making it an art of digital numismatic science.&#x20;

One $GODL token is both one-ounce bullion coin struck in 999.9 fine gold in collectable proof quality.

Our goal is to create a decentralised gold reserve currency, controlled by autonomous systems, in which the behaviour of the GODL token is optimised at a high level by the collective organisation of participants and the global gold supply.

### Guides: Pactolus Protocol

Lydus Co is a fork of $OHM on EMV compatible chains.&#x20;

Buy $GODL from the market or use the Pactolus River (coinage system) and then stamp it with the lion's seal (stake it) to receive more $GODL though DeFi Dapps

### Fundamentals: Dive a little deeper

In economic terms, we believe this methodology will consistently offer stability as the $GODL can function as a universal unit-of-account and a medium-of-exchange. Our unique innovation backing the token to gold makes it also profitable to be stored for value growth and wealth creation. Lydus Co also introduces unique gamified financial dynamics into the market through staking and bonding. Read more about the game theory aspect of Lydus Co in MEDIUM LINK.
