### Frequently Asked Questions

What is DigiGold?

DigiGold is a simple and cost-effective way to own physical gold, silver and platinum in quantities to suit all budgets, allowing you to purchase and own a fractional amount of large gold, silver and platinum bars that are held securely in The Vault™.

These large bars allow us to offer economies of scale and pass on the savings to customers. Unlike buying coins or bars, it enables you to purchase gold, silver and platinum-based on value rather than weight e.g. £25 instead of a 1 oz. coin or bar, providing you with control and flexibility. Please note that DigiGold products cannot be delivered.

Does DigiGold attract Capital Gains Tax for UK customers?How is buying DigiGold different to buying coins or bars?How does DigiGold work?How is my DigiGold stored?How do I open a DigiGold account?&#x20;

**tax**

Yes, it does. If you are looking for CGT exemption, then all UK legal tender bullion coins from The Royal Mint can offer this benefit. If you are unsure about implications in relation to capital gains tax, please speak to your financial adviser.

**different from nft?**

DigiGold offers direct ownership of real physical gold, silver or platinum without the delivery or fabrication fees associated with coins and bars. Unlike coins and bars, DigiGold enables you to purchase gold, silver and platinum-based on value rather than weight e.g. £25 instead of a 1 oz. coin or bar.

As you purchase fractions of a large bar, DigiGold cannot be delivered. Subject to a minimum order value of £25, you can purchase any amount you choose in 0.001 ounce units, and unlike larger coins and bars, you can spend exactly what you choose.

**how it works?**

The Royal Mint buys large bars and stores them securely within The Vault™. Subject to a minimum order value of £25, you can purchase fractions of these bars to the nearest 0.001 oz., but unlike buying coins or bars, it enables you to purchase gold, silver and platinum-based on value rather than weight e.g. £25 instead of a 1 oz. coin or bar.

When you purchase DigiGold, you own it and have legal title to it, with The Royal Mint acting as a custodian only. This means that we don’t have any direct claim on the gold you’ve purchased, and you have the assurance that your gold, silver and platinum are protected.

**how?**

DigiGold allows you to purchase and own individual ounces of large 400 oz. gold, silver and platinum bars, that are held securely in The Vault™. These large 400 oz. bars allow us to offer economies of scale to our clients and pass on the savings. Please note that DigiGold cannot be delivered.

**account?**

DigiGold is a product offered alongside our existing investment coins and bars. If you already have an Invest account on royalmint.com, then you simply need to log in to purchase digital gold, silver and platinum.

If you haven’t opened an Invest account, this process only takes a few minutes to complete. Once your application is approved, you can add funds and begin trading.
