# FAQ

## Why do we need Lydus Co?&#x20;

Fiat-pegged stablecoins have become an essential part of crypto transactions due to their lack of volatility as compared to tokens such as Bitcoin and Ether. Users are comfortable using stablecoins knowing that they hold the same amount of purchasing power over time. This is clearly a wrong assumption, as[ illustrated by the example](https://howmuch.net/articles/rise-and-fall-dollar) showing that in 1913, $100 worth of dollars would buy you $3.87 worth of valuables in 2019.&#x20;

This means that the depreciation of dollars equates to a depreciation of these stablecoins, along with any assets you may own and hold over the years.

Lydus Co aims to solve this by creating an algorithmic gold reserve currency, $GODL, that is backed by physical gold. By focusing on supply growth rather than price appreciation, Lydus Co protocol ensures that $GODL can function as a currency that is able to hold its purchasing power in spite of market volatility.



## Is GLYD a stable coin?

No, GLYD is not a stable coin, due to positive reinforcement the value of the coin would grow but when comparing BTC and gold from 2010 to 2020, BTC offered a financial return of +469,482% and gold was down -3%.&#x20;

We can calculate the logarithmic trajectory of earnings and growth into the algorithm and project cooling down periods for selling gold from the reserve to reduce the chances of a negative outcome.&#x20;

GODL aspires to become the main algorithmic reserve currency in the market, backed by gold. Blockhain now meets the gold standard, providing a free floating value its users can always have faith in, obviously, because of the physical $godl treasury vaults, GLYD draws a true intrinsic value from.

## GLYD is backed, not pegged.

Each GODL is backed by 1 Kilo of Gold, not pegged to it. Because the treasury backs every GODL with at least 1 Kilo of Gold, the protocol would buy back and burn GODL when it trades below 1 MIM. This has the effect of pushing OHM price back up to 1 DAI. OHM could always trade above 1 DAI because there is no upper limit imposed by the protocol. Think pegged == 1, while backed >= 1.

You might say that the OHM floor price or intrinsic value is 1 DAI. We believe that the actual price will always be 1 DAI + premium, but in the end that is up to the market to decide.
