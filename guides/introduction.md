# Introduction

## What is Lydus Co?

Lydus Co is a decentralised reserve currency _**Coinage As A Service**_ protocol. It enables stakeholders to **own and hold**, the liquidity of its _**gold-backed treasury**_, in both individual and collective, segregated and allocated custody storages (Grade-X Vaults), making our **community the decentralised bank that issues credit of the protocol**.

Lydus was a legendary figure of the 2nd millennium BC who is attested by Herodotus to have been an early king of Lydia and possibly related to the **Heraclidae dynasty**, descendants of Heracles. According to **a consensus of numismatic historians, the Lydian stater was the first coin** officially issued by a government in world history and was the model for virtually all subsequent coinage.&#x20;

Lydus Co is here to establish the evolution of our current money systems **merging together Gold and DeFi, making $GODL & Liquid Proof Coins the primary medium of exchange and store of wealth** in a modern **decentralized and highly automated monetary system**.&#x20;

It combines the intangible properties of cryptocurrencies with the dual nature of gold, acting both as an investment and as a consumer good, all the while maintaining strong cultural and religious significances and thereby being of **universal demand**.

## What is GODL?

$GODL is an **algorithmic reserve currency and real gold, money**.&#x20;

The $GODL supply increases as the treasury and stakeholders acquire more gold bars in **the NFT registry and more liquid-proof** coins get distributed to the public. Stakeholders benefit, in the same way, from holding **$GODL as it's representative of both physical and digital value**.&#x20;

Stakeholders can transfer, at any point, the proof coins' through physical transport to their home or business or, vice versa, exchange the coins as money in the physical world as they are registered as identical in the ledger.&#x20;

This model offers a thousand-year-old solution from a sound metaphysical perspective to the failure of fiat monetary systems, where centralised banks accumulate more assets for nothing by minting new currency benefiting only a few central actors from inflation. If you’re buying gold or cryptocurrency as part of a portfolio diversification strategy, $GODL is a meeting of minds through the Middle Way. Simply, it achieves protection in an event of a system-wide crisis, as stakeholders own the physical metal that accrues yield on the DeFi protocol and can be traded both online and offline in the Omniverse.&#x20;

With our monetary policy model, a percentage of the inflating supply goes to participants through compounding returns, which they receive every 8 hours that can redeem for Algorithmically Liquid Proof Coins.

Furthermore, a distribution of Proof Coins to the stakeholders by the Wrap and Lock Function in the dashboard app now becomes a distributed reality, enabling us to create together a truly Decentralised Reserve banking protocol.&#x20;

This means that your coins are your keys and your keys are your coins, for real.&#x20;

This model is also different from Bitcoin and many of the previous generation cryptocurrencies that focus on a fixed supply with an increase in price. In order to operate in optimal conditions, we have employed a balancing algorithm to keep the price of GODL stable that will be available on GitHub.&#x20;

Stakeholders will benefit from holding “liquid-proof coins” by an increase of tokens in their wallets as new participants use our financial ecosystem and more people hold GODL in our Treasury and in collective, forming the Reserve.&#x20;

The Universe and DeFi world merge by offering Professional Minting services for issuing Proof Coins for Professional Partnerships, in decentralised projects, like OHM or other DAO Governance Tokens, as well as to Corporations and Governments that want to reduce systemic risk. \
\
Fiat currencies and Stablecoins, can now be backed by their governments and the GDP of their countries with $GODL.

Bitcoin and all other V1 cryptocurrencies are valuable purely because people believe they have value. $GODL has both intrinsic and extrinsic value as is made up of 1 Oz of 99.999 pure gold,  backed by additional reserves, simultaneously generating yield with decentralised finance, giving us the first-ever in history, the invention of Liquid-Proof Coins.&#x20;

$GODL is backed by a treasury invested in physical gold a distributed to the public bullion, and proof coins that together form the Reserve as well as in investments in gold miner ETF's.&#x20;



## What is the Purpose of Lydus Co and $GODL?

Our goal is to create a decentralized gold reserve currency, controlled by partially autonomous systems, in which the behaviour of the GODL token is optimized at a high level by the collective organization of producers, refiners, fabricators and end-users.

Our goal is to create an automated governance system, with an independent currency backed by physical gold, in order to provide an alternative to depreciating fiat currencies, providing a stable asset on which we can use for conducting economic activities.&#x20;

We envision $GODL used as a universal medium of exchange and a global store of value.

## Can $GODL deliver a high APY?

The first reason returns are so huge is that they auto-compound every hours so that you continue to earn rewards on top of your rewards.

Another reason for the high APY is the stage in the life cycle of the protocol. GODL tokens that are paid out to stakeholders are minted when bonders sell their assets to the treasury in exchange for GURU. The rate of the APY depends on the rate that the ecosystem is growing. During the early stages of the protocol, while the market cap is small and growth is rapid, the APY numbers can seem too good to be true. As the market cap grows, the APY will drop, balancing out as the currency reaches stabilization.

## **How can You Participate in Lydus Co?**

There are two main strategies for market participants: staking and bonding. Stakeholders stake their GODL tokens in return for more GODL tokens, while bonders provide LP, DAI tokens, or wBTC, wETH in exchange for discounted GODL tokens after a fixed vesting period.

Governance participants can get involved through discussions on our community discord server.&#x20;

We welcome for new community members to take part in building a decentralised bank!

## How can I Benefit from GODL?

The main benefit for stakeholders comes from supply growth. The protocol mints new GODL tokens from the treasury, the majority of which are distributed to the stakeholders. Thus, the gain for stakeholders will come from their auto-compounding balances, though price exposure remains an important consideration. That is, if the increase in token balance outpaces the potential drop in price (due to inflation), stakeholders make a profit.

The main benefit for bonders comes from price consistency. Bonders commit capital upfront and are promised a fixed return at a set point in time; that return is in GODL and thus the bonder's profit would depend on GODL price when the bond matures. Bonders benefit from a rising or static GODL price.

## Who Created Lydus Co?

The founder Michalis Papaiakovou worked for a Private Equity Firm investing in Oil and Gas, Shipping and Infrastructure projects, like refineries. He has also been involved in FOREX, Hedge Funds, Law Firms, the Legal Service, the Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Cyprus and has consulted the Republic's Parliament as a member of the Council on Electronic Governance, Research, and Innovation. &#x20;

Lydus Co is developed from an improved adoption of a fork of Olympus DAO on the Avalanche network.&#x20;

## Who runs Lydus Co?

Currently, most of the decisions are taken by the Founding Team, and we expect to be able to turn more of our operations into automated and peer reviewed governance models progressively, always with respect to the principle of the Golden Means.
