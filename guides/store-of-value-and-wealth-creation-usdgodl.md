Bonding is one of the ways in which Lydus Co generates profits. The protocol will sell bonds of other tokens like DAI for discounted HEC tokens, which will then be vested for gradual release to the bonding party. This allows full-time investors to actively manage their HEC portfolio and generate significant rewards over time whilst also supporting the growth of the Hector DAO by financing its liquidity and facilitating more upwards price movement.

## Spot

Staking is an integral part of the Hector DAO. Investors will stake their HEC, locking it into the ecosystem and receiving compounding rewards in sHEC (which will always be exchangeable for HEC at a 1:1 ratio) generated by bond sales. Over time, the amount of HEC owned by stakers will increase, bringing more profit and reducing exposure risk. Staking HEC becomes less risky and more profitable over time since an increasing share of HEC will protect investors from negative price action, and given that the protocol ensures a price floor of 1 HEC per DAI, staking for long enough will guarantee profit.

Staking locks your HEC and gives you an equal balance of sHEC, which compounds automatically. To unstake, sHEC is burned for an equal balance of HEC.\
